# shinyRrisk
App for stochastic, quantitative risk assesmment using R and Shiny.


## Download

Download the project either directly from this repository, or on the command line use the following in the directory of your choice:

```console
git clone https://github.com/RobertOpitz/shinyRrisk.git
```

If you downloaded a .zip file, unzip it, and move it to the directory of your choice.


## Starting shinyRrisk from command line

You may start shinyRrisk from the command line using the program `Rscript` that is part of R. Go into the shinyRrisk folder, and use the following command: 

```console
Rscript shinyRrisk.R
```
If your R does not have all of the necessary packages needed for shinyRrisk, they will be downloaded and installed by shinyRrisk. You may call `shinyRrisk.R` twice using `Rscript`. 


## Starting shinyRrisk with RStudio

 First go to the shinyRrisk directory. You can use in RStudio `...` for this.
