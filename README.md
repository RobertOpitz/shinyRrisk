## Starting shinyRrisk from command line

You may start shinyRrisk from the command line using the program `Rscript` that is part of R. Go into the shinyRrisk folder, and use the following command: 

```console
Rscript shinyRrisk.R
```
If your R does not have all of the necessary packages needed for shinyRrisk, they will be downloaded and installed by shinyRrisk. **Then, you may call `shinyRrisk.R` twice using `Rscript`.**
